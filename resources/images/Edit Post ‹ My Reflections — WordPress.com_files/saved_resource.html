Consumer information was accessed including names, social security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and driver's licenses numbers. Credit card numbers were accessed for around 209,000 consumers and personal identifying information was accessed of around 182,000 consumers. &nbsp;All in all, sensitive personal information was compromised for over 143 million Americans in the US, which is almost half of the entire population of the world's leading high tech country.</p><h2>Why did it happen?</h2><p>Now some of you are wondering how is it possible to hack into one of the most secure credit agencies in the US. Well, no matter how much security you have on the data, there is always a loophole. Finding that loop hole is a hacker's job, and to close loop holes is the job of security patches.</p><p>The flaws that allowed hackers to penetrate Equifax &nbsp;was issued a security patch several months ago. The flaw that the hackers exploited is within the Apache Struts and is identified as CVE-2017-5638. This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands through a specified string letting them access anything they wish to. Instead of Equifax fixing this flaw the day it was issued, the company waited more than 2 months risking the lives of half of the population. They finally fixed it on March 6, 2017 but it was too late and their website was under heavy attack. The incompetence of Equifax to simply install a security patch demonstrates the lax security practices that the company upholds and how serious they are about releasing the most critical personal data on Americans, more critical than your social media.</p><h2>How does it impact?</h2><p>This calamity has caused havoc in the country resulting in people losing their most valuable information. Now we have foreign hackers who have our social security numbers and other potent information they can toy around with. With this information they can "impersonate us and apply for loans, housing, utilities, and government benefits" says Craig Timberg from <em>The Washington Post.&nbsp;</em></p><h2>The Credit Score Historical Facts</h2><h2>Credit history and American economy</h2><h2>What should the government do?
